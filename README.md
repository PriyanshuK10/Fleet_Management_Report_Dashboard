### Project Overview

The Fleet Management project aims to enhance operational efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and revenue optimization for the fleet management operations. Leveraging key performance indicators (KPIs) and advanced analytics, the project focuses on providing valuable insights into fuel consumption, maintenance costs, driver performance, and revenue generation..
#

### Background

Efficient fleet management is crucial for minimizing costs, ensuring driver safety, and maximizing revenue. The Fleet Management project was initiated to address challenges related to fuel efficiency, maintenance, and overall operational optimization. By utilizing data-driven decision-making, the project aims to streamline operations and enhance overall fleet performance.
#

### Scope

The project encompasses the analysis of various KPIs across company-wide and driver-specific metrics, as well as revenue-related insights. The scope includes monitoring liters consumed, total drives, kilometers traveled, fixed costs, fuel consumed, maintenance costs, average speed, fuel efficiency, and revenue-related metrics.
#

### Stakeholders

 1. Fleet Management Team
 2. Finance Department
 3. Drivers
 4. Operations Team
 5. Executive Leadership

#

### Data Sources
The primary data sources for the Fleet Management project include the "costs" table for company-related metrics and the "freight" table for revenue-related insights. Additionally, the project integrates information from the "dim_driver" and "dim_states" tables to enrich driver and customer data.

#


### Tools Used

 - Excel- Data Cleaning
 - Power BI- Data Visualization and Analysis
 - SQL- Data Retrival
#


### Methodology

The Fleet Management project employs a combination of SQL queries and Power BI to analyze and visualize key metrics. The methodology includes aggregating and summarizing data to derive meaningful insights into fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, driver performance, and revenue generation.
